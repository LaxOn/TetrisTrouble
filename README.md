# TetrisTrouble

TetrisTrouble is a game that is similar to tetris but with some troublesome twist\s.

What's the trouble you ask?

SPOILER ALERT:

Just like in normal Tetris once an entire row becomes filled, something happens.
It's just in this case, instead of the filled row disappearing and everything above going down, AN ENTIRE COLUMN BECOMES ADDED AND IS PLAYABLE!



Compilation Note:
Requires SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to be installed.
